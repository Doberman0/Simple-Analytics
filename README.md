# Simple-Analytics
A simple analytics API created for Suade's technical challenge. Based on 6 csv files, we attempt to efficiently iterate through them appropriately to find the data for the following:

-Total number of items sold that day
-Total number of customers that made an order that day
-Total amount of discount on that day
-Average discount rate applied to the items sold that day
-Average order total for that day
-Total amount of commissions generated that day
-Average amound of commisions generated that day
-Total amount of commisions earned per promotion that day

And return this information as a report.
